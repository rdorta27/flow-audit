# Changelog

Versions follow semver. `core` sets the numbers; the `site` repository reuses the same
tag when it publishes that version.

## Unreleased

### Changed

- The plan moves from six phases to milestones M0–M5 (`../specs/flow-audit_BACKLOG.md`):
  validate one integration candidate, one read-only adapter, correlation, one rule, one report.
- Status lines in README, AGENTS and docs now name the version and milestone.
- This version is declared English only; Spanish and Portuguese output are deferred.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-10-28

Baseline before milestone M0. Old tags `0.1.0` and `0.2.0` were removed; this release
replaces them and is aligned with `site` 0.1.0.

### Added

- Deterministic Ortelis dataset: 5,000 orders in a fixed September 2026 window.
- Versioned exports in `data/demo/`: catalog, OMS, BPM, provisioning, config and expected numbers.
- `deno task dataset` regenerates the dataset from a fixed seed.
- Invariant suite covering the data-model rules and the five defect cohorts.
- Deno toolchain pinned in `mise.toml`, with `check`, `test` and `audit` tasks.
- Hexagonal skeleton: `domain`, `ports`, `adapters`, `app` and `cli`.
- Canonical model types: events, catalog, orders, journeys, impact and findings.
- Boundary test that keeps `domain/` free of I/O and the project free of runtime dependencies.
- Walking-skeleton CLI that exits with code 2 and a clear message when no evidence source exists.
- ADR 0002: hexagonal layout and the dependency rule.
- Product definition: problem, buyer, scope, demo, success criteria.
- Architecture overview: local-first CLI, pipeline, stack, limits.
- Data model: catalog, orders, events, correlation and impact.
- Rule catalogue R01–R05 with signal, evidence and impact formula.
- ADR 0001: local-first CLI with a static report.
- MVP requirements R1–R6 and non-functional requirements.
- BSS order-flow glossary.

### Changed

- README now states the phase and what runs today (nothing).
- Renamed the product to Flow Audit.
- Renumbered the roadmap: architecture and model (1), dataset (2), site (3), ingest (4),
  rules (5), report and publish (6).
- Aligned the demo order and the R04 signal with the generated dataset.
